# unit-converter
Free spreadsheet-based unit converter

# Getting started
[Download](https://github.com/sashahafner/unit-converter/raw/main/unit-converter.xlsx) and open the unit-converter.xlsx file.
Enter a input value, input units and exponents, and an output value is automatically calculated.
Check detailed error messages in red if no value is returned.
One common problem is a blank input unit cell--use "." instead.
The examples below should be helpful for getting started.

# Examples

See the "C" sheet to find a description of the available constants.

# More details
Use the "Regular" sheet unless you want to carry out a calculation that includes constants (see example 3 above).

The S, D, F, and C sheets contain SI prefixes, dimensions, conversion factors, and constants.
Users can find descriptions and sources in these sheets, or add additional factors or constants.
